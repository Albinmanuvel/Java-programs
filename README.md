 # Java Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java programs designed for beginner developers to practice and improve their coding skills. These projects cover a variety of concepts and provide an excellent opportunity to explore different areas of programming.

## Projects

1. **BMI Calculator**
   - Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's height and weight inputs.
   - Provides the BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese) along with the calculated value.

2. **Calendar Generator**
   - Displays a calendar for a given month and year.
   - Allows the user to navigate between different months and years.

3. **Fibonacci Series**
   - Generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.
   - The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

4. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Checks whether a given string is a palindrome (a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward).

5. **Password Strength Checker**
   - Evaluates the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters.
   - Provides feedback on how to improve the password's strength.

6. **Sudoku Solver**
   - Solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking or other algorithms.
   - Allows the user to input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle, and the program finds the solution.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official Oracle website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

Once you have JDK installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the Java file you want to run using the `javac` command followed by the file name (e.g., `javac BMICalculator.java`).
4. Run the compiled class file using the `java` command followed by the class name (e.g., `java BMICalculator`).
